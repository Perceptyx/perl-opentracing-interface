=head1 NAME

OpenTracing::Types - Type constraints for checking Interfaces

=cut



our $VERSION = 'v0.206.0';



=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use OpenTracing::Types qw/Span/;
    #
    # imports the 'Span' Type
    
    use Types::Standard qw/Maybe/;
    use Types::Common::Numeric qw/PositiveOrZeroNum/;
    
    use Function::Parameters;
    use Function::Return;
    
    # create a subroutine with some fancy type checks
    #
    sub time_gap (Span $span1, Span $span2) :Return Maybe[PositiveOrZeroNum] {
        return unless $span1->finish_time and $span2->start_time;
        return $span2->start_time - $span1->finish_time
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This library of L<Type::Tiny> type constraints provide Duck Type checks for all
common elements that conform L<OpenTracing::Interface>

See L<Type::Library/"Export"> about the various ways to import types an related
methods.

# Dear developer, for the sake of testing, please DO NOT just copy paste the
# methods from the `OpenTracing::Types` file. If I wanted to just
# check that the `duck_type` utility from `Type::Tiny` would work, I would have
# not needed this test.
#
# This test is to ensure that what is written in the POD files is indeed what
# the Types library is doing.
#
# The OpenTracing::Interface::*.pod files are leading, not the code.
